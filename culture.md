# Netlify Culture
A company is only as good as the team of people who work there, therefore, a team is only as good as its culture.

We aim to be as deliberate as possible in how we scale our organization and culture. Here follows a short overview of our organizational philosophy and our values.

## Organizational philosophy
We believe in a clearly defined organization. This avoids a big problem in completely flat organizations that become a place where whoever yells the loudest gets their way.
A clearly defined organization allows us to best set up individuals for success. Each person knowing, at all times, what their responsibilities are, and just as importantly, what they aren't, makes it easier to prioritize work. Additionally, knowing there is a supportive leadership hierarchy, clearly defines who can 'break a tie' and have the 'final say' when a conflict arises.

We firmly believe that The Best Idea Can Come From Anywhere. 

Netlify is a team of cross functional people that enjoy sharing ideas and tactics within and across teams.

In order for colleagues to share ideas across teams, a culture of transparency and empowerment is needed. 

## Values
Our values at Netlify are Transparency, Empowerment and Commitment. 

Ideas cannot spread in an organization where there is no knowledge goes on outside your team. Transparency helps us align on common goals, be cross functional, and make everyone feel they are part of 'the big team' as much as their individual team.

Our mission is to create structures that arm the individual with the right framework that empowers them to make their own decisions on how they best contribute to achieve our collective goals.

We're a team pushing a radical idea: the future of the web depends on a healthier ecosystem of tools and methodologies. Therefore, we approach every line of code, support ticket, meet-up talk, sales call, and piece of documentation with a high bar for quality. Weâ€™re driven by passion and a firm commitment to do right by our team and our community. 


## The Best Idea Can Come From Anywhere
There is no simple solution to permeate this across the organization. However, we believe that a collection of initiatives put us on the path to successfully enabling this motto. These initiatives include:
* Celebrating each others victories.
* Intentional knowledge sharing.
* Video hangouts.
* Frequent all hands.
* Sharing information in a way that the value is understandable for everyone.
* Having new engineers push to production within 48 hours. 
* Making sure that we create a space where individuals can tell their manager anything - without fear of repercussions. 
In short we aim to create an environment where everyone is not just heard, but listened to.

## Empathy
With a group of passionate, smart, and driven people one could imagine meetings turning into shouting matches. This is why we have a strong focus on finding passionate people that are also empathetic. Understanding and sharing the feelings of others leads to better collaboration. Each individual and their ideas are respected by their peers and leadership.

## Disagree and commit
Designing by committee, shortly put, doesn't work. People have different skill sets and different responsibilities. We're not aiming to create a unanimous culture, but a culture where everyone knows when and how to give measured feedback. Where individuals don't just get a chance to speak their mind to someone who has already made up theirs, but where they are actually listened to. We find that this communication is critical to come to a consensus to move forward in unison, even if there are some points of contention and disagreement.

## Team distribution
As mentioned above, Netlify is a partially distributed company. More than half of of the employees work remotely and the rest work out of the HQ in San Francisco. We're committed to making this work, and have structured work at Netlify to support this. We pride ourselves on having a distributed culture.

## Face to face
* Frequent all hands
* Lots of video calls
* Generous conference budget 

## Knowledge sharing
We aim to be deliberate in our online communications whether it be Slack, email, git, Notion or Google Drive.

## Work from home days
In HQ, we have 2 work from home days (Tuesdays and Thursday) every week. We do this to ensure that we work together with the remote part of the company as well as possible. 

## Some leadership is also distributed
We have many leaders that are working remotely. Examples include VP of Marcom, Creative Director, Product Engineering manager, Head of Support.

## Career paths for everyone, not just the people in HQ
We're adamant about having a distributed culture. This means having career paths for both IC's and managers, including all remote team members, no matter where in the world they are.
